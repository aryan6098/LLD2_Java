## Builder Pattern Implementation for a messaging service
### Problem Statement

You are developing a messaging application with support for various message types, including text, images, audio, and video. Each message type can have additional attributes and settings, such as delivery status and timestamps. The current approach of creating message objects using multiple overloaded constructors has become error-prone and challenging to maintain. You should streamline the creation of message objects with different configurations and immutable objects.

### Assignment
Your task is to implement the Builder pattern to create instances of message objects with different configurations. The Builder pattern allows for step-by-step construction of complex objects while keeping the creation process separate from the main object.

### Implementing the Builder Pattern
- Review the original class: You have been provided with a class named Message. This class represents different message types and their attributes. Your task is to implement the Builder pattern to create instances of a class with the same properties.

- Create the builder class: Create a new class called MessageBuilder that will implement the builder patter. A dummy class has been provided for you to start with. Remember to annotate the class with the @WithBuilder annotation. The name does not matter as long as it is annotated.

- Test your implementation: Test cases has been provided for you to test your implementation. Run the test case to ensure that your implementation is correct.

### Instructions
- Create a new class annotated with the @WithBuilder annotation.
- Implement the builder pattern within your MessageBuilder class.
- Run the provided test cases in the MessageBuilderTest class to verify the correctness of your implementation.
